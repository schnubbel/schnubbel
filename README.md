You there! Ogre.

  
Aye.

  
By the order of Lord Farquaad
I am authorized
to place you both under arrest
and transport you
to a designated resettlement facility.

  
Oh, really? You and what army?

  
Can I say something to you?

  
You was really, really something
back there. Incredible.

  
Are you talking to...
...me?

  
Yes, I was talking to you.
You was really great back there.

  
Those guards, they thought they was
all that. You showed up, and bam!

  
Tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

  
That really made me
feel good to see that.

  
That's great. Really.

  
Man, it's good to be free.

  
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

  
Hm?

  
But, uh
I don't have any friends.

  
And I'm not going out there by myself.

  
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.
I'll stick with you!

  
You a mean, green fighting machine.

  
Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.
